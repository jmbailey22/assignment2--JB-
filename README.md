#Dataset
I used the penguins.csv file for my data set and it showed types of penguins, species, bill length and depth, flipper length and body mass. These penguins and body measurements were obtained from the Palmer Archipelago. 

#Name of data analysis script and what it does
I named my data analysis script Bailey_Asgn2.R and it runs a regression of body mass against flipper length and creates a scatter plot with this regression adding in a regression line. I also added in some descriptive summary statistics for the data like mean bill depth, mean bill length, mean body mass, and mean flipper length. The analysis also includes outputs of my scatterplot and a table of my mean body measurements. 

#How to reproduce analysis
In order to reproduce analysis you would have to clone this repository to your computer from GitHub and place the necessary data set, in this case the penguins.csv file in the same folder. Then you can open my R file, Bailey_Asgn2.R in RStudio and run the script which should generate the same outputs I detailed above.
